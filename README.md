# Rock Paper Scissors
This is a simple rock paper scissors minigame.  You will choose a weapon, then the CPU selects a weapon. When the selections are revealed, a winner is decided and given a point.  Rock beats scissors.  Scissors beat paper.  Paper beats rock.  A tie results in no one winning any points.  Though there are rounds, there is no limit to how many you can play.

## Development
I created this game with HTML/CSS, JS and GSAP in about 8 hours.
